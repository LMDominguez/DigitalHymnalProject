# DigitalHymnalProject
This repo contains a project proposal idea for Coding Dojo.

The purpose of Digital Hymnal is to provide a lyric display alternative for small to medium sized worship gatherings. Primary use cases for this application would be (1) in a home setting where traditional projector equipment is unavailable or (2) outdoor settings, for largely the same reason. This application could help save on larger equipment costs and/or extensive printing, allowing users to create and customize their own lyric sets.

How it works:
The vision for this application is to operate like a combination of a jackbox.tv application and a crowd-sync application like Crowdr. A Primary User will create an account, create, edit, and save their own lyric sets. This user can then launch a session which other Secondary Users can join via a 5 character room access code. The Secondary Users will have lyrics fed to their mobile devices with the display mostly controlled by a Primary User.
